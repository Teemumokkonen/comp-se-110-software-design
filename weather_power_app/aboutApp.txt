1. Introduction
This app is a simple graph app which get data from fmi-api and fingrid api and makes graphs from the 
fetched data. This program can fetch multiple data from the apis at a time, but it is recommended that user selects only two 
data sets at a time. Otherwise the app will get quite slow and the graphs will be crowded. 


2. How to use this app
First user selects which data sets are wanted to be fetched.
User selects second from which place data is wanted(standard is pirkkala).
After data sets and place has been chosen the user selects the duration from which the data is wanted by selecting how many
days is wanted to be proceeded from the date that will be chosen from the calender widget.

(NOTE 1: Weather data can only be for a period of 7 days max. This is due to fmi-api.)
(NOTE 2: Some places may not have all data sets available to the them). 
(NOTE 3: When trying to fetch large amount of data (e.g 100m days) it is recommended that only one 
	 Data set is selected. Otherwise the program can be quite slow.)

Some data sets will not be allowed to be called at the same time such as focecast data and observation data.

5. LCD numbers:

6. Nice to know:

-If user make mistake during saving preferences or data, the file could be corrupted, and user must clear the whole file manually. Text files “debugpreferences” and “debugsaves” are located in build folder.
