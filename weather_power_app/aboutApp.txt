1. Introduction
This app is a simple graph app which get data from fmi-api and fingrid api and makes graphs from the 
fetched data. This program can fetch multiple data from the apis at a time, but it is recommended that user selects only two 
data sets at a time. Otherwise the app will get quite slow and the graphs will be crowded. 


2. How to use this app
First user selects which data sets are wanted to be fetched.
User selects second from which place data is wanted(standard is pirkkala).
After data sets and place has been chosen the user selects the duration from which the data is wanted by selecting how many
days is wanted to be proceeded from the date that will be chosen from the calender widget.

(NOTE:some places may not have all data sets available to the them). 

Some data sets will not be allowed to be called at the same time such as focecast data and observation data.
